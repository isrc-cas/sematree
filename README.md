Thank you for your attention to our SemaTree work.


SemaTree has achieved the state of the art in many datasets.


Since the paper is still in the review stage, the code and model will be changed to be visible after the review (February, 2020).


At present, we are also continuing to carry out new related work.


Welcome to pay attention to the new progress of the intelligent software research center in ISCAS!


If you still have some questions, please concact me.
